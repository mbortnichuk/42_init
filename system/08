- To acces there file you need to follow next steps:
-> #ssh-keygen
-> press ENTER after entering command above.
-> if ssh folder already exists you need overwrite it by entering 'Y' after popping question in terminal window.
-> OR you can delete this folder directly from your terminal by executing next command ->
-> #rm -rf /home/user/.ssh/
-> enter random passphrase twice to confirm creating new RSA keys ("hello" e.g.).
-> enter .ssh folder with your just created RSA keys by executing next command ->
-> #cd ~/.ssh/ -> ls
-> there you will see id_rsa -> which is private RSA key and id_rsa.pub -> which is public RSA key obv.
-> you can cat them if you want to see some abrakadabra ;)
