First of all you need to cat file "resolv.conf" in which are configured IP addresses of the DNS name servers.
cat /etc/resolv.conf
This file is automatically generated by your request.
As you need to get the complete path of the file that contains the IP addresses of the DNS server you're using, run following command ->
cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver
